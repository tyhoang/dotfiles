[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
I was thinking we could kick it
And you'd be my Nehruvian empress
I promised that only dreams we would witness
But you seeing something different
I know that this your mind not your intuition
'Cause you in the system giving them tuition

And yes, I respect your position
But I'm just saying that your brain ain't missin'
So while you playing these games let me listen
Me and you could be slaying all competition

We both see the vision, so let's make it happen
Dreaming without napping, euphoric satisfaction
We've grown with the passion, in flame for each other
So I wonder why we don't have a name for each other

Enough with the games, sweet lips soft land
Let me know what you saying, 'cause my flight ain't delayed
There's no time for waitin'
Forget about them hatin'
On the other side
Nehruvian [?] Bishy's trying to vibe

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinking that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?

I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm trying to break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?

(Uh)

[Second verse: Bishop Nehru]
They usually play games, so it ain't nothing new to me
I'm used to being the teen who wins the queens musically
I tried through unity
Emotion wasn't workin'
'Cause they weren't seein'
But I'm finally with a bein' who believes in

With what I do or don't for that matter
The fact that we can chat attracts and makes you badder
I hoping that that will flatter, not push you down the ladder
Don't mean to make you sad or [?] so

No pressure, my bless friend [?]
Don't even got a dress shirt, you divine sun dresser
And we avoiding lecture, so there's no need to dis
We know that you can't miss me without it ending in a mystery

'Cause they know that we pounding out the misery
Is literally killing me
I'm hoping that you slip and see
That you and me were meant to be
That you and me were meant to be
We were meant to be

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinking that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?

I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm trying to break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?

(Trying to break the hold)

(Let's go)

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinking that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?

I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm trying to break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?
