I'm always highest in the room
There's nothing new
Trippin' on, trippin' on mushrooms
Flyin' through the rooms
I'm a madman from the Moon
Change up your view
I be bossin', bossin' on them rules
Smokin' out the school
Slowly gliding, gliding in the pure
I found the cure
This way to truest, truest you
Boy, you can do
I'm lookin', lookin' out for you
Pay-per-view
There is nothing I can't do
Now you need to find my crew
Find my crew, find my crew
