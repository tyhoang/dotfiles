[Tracy:]
You got the invitation

[Alexis:]
You got the right address

[Tracy:]
You need some medication?

[Caitlin:]
The answer's always yes

[Tracy:]
A little chance encounter
Could be the one you've waited for

[Alexis, Caitlin & Tracy:]
Just squeeze a bit more

[Alexis:]
Tonight we're on a mission
Tonight's the casting call

[Caitlin:]
If this is the real audition

[Mia:]
Oh, God, help us all

[Tracy:]
You make the right impression
Then ev'rybody knows your name

[Alexis & Caitlin:]
We're in the fast lane

[Alexis:]
Someone in the crowd
Could be the one you need to know
The one to fin'lly lift you off the ground

[Tracy:]
Someone in the crowd could
Take you where you wanna go
If you're the someone ready to be found

[Alexis:]
The someone ready to be found

[Caitlin & Tracy:]
Do what you need to do
'Til they discover you

[Alexis, Caitlin & Tracy:]
And make you more than who
You're seeing now
So with the stars aligned

[Mia:]
I think I'll stay behind

[Alexis, Caitlin & Tracy:]
You've got to go and find

[Caitlin:]
That someone in the crowd

[All:]
That someone in the crowd

[Mia:]
Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round?
Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
A somewhere that's just waiting to be found

[All:]
Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The someone who could lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
Someone in the crowd could make you
Someone in the crowd could take you
Flying off the ground
If you're the someone ready to be found
