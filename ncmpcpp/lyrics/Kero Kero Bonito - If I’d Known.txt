Looking back, I ponder all the possibilities
That I had sat right in front of me
Every one an optional decision
Giving birth to a dedicated universe

Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road

But I heard that every single version of events
Will occur whatever we expect
And as such, I really needn't worry very much
'Cause I feel all worlds at once

Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Reality proves me
It goes pretty smoothly
But I haven't found the meaning
Quite yet

Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road
Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Who tore the sky? Who copied me?
Water going back on itself, up to the sea
Is that, a whole world talking from just behind a ceiling?
Watch me get my two timelines
Not going through the door all alone
I leave something on the side
So you know I said hello
