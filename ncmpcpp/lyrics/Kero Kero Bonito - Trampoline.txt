As the rain came down my window
I heard the wind blow all around
I was stuck under the weather
Felt like forever out of the sun
But then I looked at my garden
And saw at the bottom my old trampoline
That's when I knew what to do
I could break right on through
Yeah, the clouds aren't so high

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

Though I love it when I'm floating
It's kind of lonely at the top
But if we all jump together
Then we'll go higher
We'll never stop
I know I've got to come down
Put my feet on the ground soon
But that's okay
You see, I'm safe in the knowledge
No matter what, I got my old trampoline

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

つまずいて落ちてくことってあるけど
どん底の底の底って何があるか知ってる？
どんどん落ちていくとトランポリンがあるんだよ
突き落とされても大丈夫
手をあげて飛び上がれ！

Even if you're falling, that's okay
There's a trampoline waiting for you
It's so easy, you just have to believe
信じればいいんだよ

So jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)
